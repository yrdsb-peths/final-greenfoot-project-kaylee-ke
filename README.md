# Final Greenfoot Project
This is the README.md file.

The game description:

The rocket enters a cluster of meteorites, it needs to avoid all the meteorites and touches the red button to win. Your score will increase (if you use <right> to move the rocket) or decrease (if you use <left> to move the rocket) in the process of trying to touch the button. 


After touching the button, you can choose either continue playing or end the game. Note that every time after you choose to continue the game, the sizes of the meteorites will increase, except the first two rounds, which is aimed to make you get accustomed to the game. If you touch the meteorites during the game, the game will end automatically.
